<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756 in Salzburg and wrote his first symphony at the age of either four or five. Mozart's father, Leopold Mozart, was a musician himself,
  and taught both Mozart and his sister music and languages. From the age of seven to ten, Mozart toured Europe with his sister, performing for royal courts.</p><br>
<p>Mozart composed over 600 pieces in his short life. He died at the young age of 35 in 1791 and, since he was broke at the time of his death, was buried in a common
  grave. His resting place is Vienna, Austria.</p><br>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086879/" id="link" target="_blank">Amadeus</a>, the movie, won the Academy Award for Best Picture in the year 1984. Tom Hulce
  (Mozart) and F. Murray Abraham (Antonio Salieri) were the main actors in the film. The biopic took home seven other Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Sound.</p><br>
