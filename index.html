<p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in 1756 in Salzburg and wrote his first symphony at the age of either four or five. Mozart's father, Leopold Mozart, was a musician himself, and taught both Mozart and his sister music and languages. From the age of 7 to 10, Mozart toured Europe with his sister, performing for royal courts.</p><br>

<p>Mozart composed over 600 pieces in his short life. He died at the young age of 35 in 1791 and, since he was broke at the time of his death, was buried in a common grave. His resting place is Vienna, Austria.</p><br>
